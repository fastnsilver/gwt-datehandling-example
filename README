INTRODUCTION

This project is meant to demonstrate a client-side date handling utility for use with GWT.

As of 2012-11-07, this project is now 100% functional.  The reason being... it properly handles "transition days", those days that fall within time zones that respect Daylight Savings.



BACKGROUND

Reading I've done on the subject

	* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2189148/how-do-i-get-gwt-datetimeformat-to-display-using-the-server-timezone-rather-tha?rq=1
	
And the question I asked 

	* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13214624/gwt-date-handing-have-client-respect-servers-timezone
	
	

PURPOSE

I had required some help from the community to improve the current implementation so that it allowed for working with dates (days, hours, minute interval labels tied to an ISO-8601 String formatted instant) 
in whichever time zone the client accesses this application.

The constraint is that each ISO-8601 String instant will be fed to the client with a pre-defined timezone offset.  E.g., Imagine a case where "market time" is accepted as US Central Time (i.e., GMT-05:00 while Daylight Savings is in effect or GMT-06:00 while Standard Time is in effect). And anywhere the client accesses the application all instants are to be displayed in this "market time."  The utility class, CSTimeUtil.java, is documented.  It's corresponding GWTTestCase is CSTimeUtilTestGwt.java.

If you're curious, please download the source.

Thanks in advance for your time and consideration!
